## Development Update
[As we continue our tradition of summarizing the updates of our weekly hangout](http://blog.synereo.com/2015/12/02/new-bounty/), here are the highlights of this week - courtesy of our dedicated community members, @lapin7, @drbloom and @malthusjohn. Thanks, guys!
<BR>

This week brings updates from Greg's participation in a blockchain hackathon (spoiler: he was on the winning team, scoring $50k. Details next week), leading to his participation in several panels in what he describes as the best conference he's been to in the space. 
We further discuss Ethereum's Proof of Stake protocol that Greg's leading the design of using Synereo technology, talk about dev work done over the past week, and the whole gang gives their take on the best growth vectors for Synereo. (Dor thinks it's building a giant out of midgets.)
<BR>

Another important announcement is about Synereo's newest team member, Jed Walls. Jed has been on [Synereo's advisory board](https://discuss.synereo.com/t/synereo-about-us/52468/2?u=dor) for a year now, advising the team in every step of the way, and has now relocated to Silicon Valley to ramp up his involvement. Jed will be directing a coordinated marketing effort and handling public relations as well as developing the Synereo brand and coordinating our growing community. Welcome, Jed!

## Detailed Notes

### [Greg reports from Sydney, Australia](https://youtu.be/JH4GLfccKY8?t=187) <BR>

Greg is in Australia participating in a Hackathon on blockchain applications. Interesting projects include one that [Vlad Zamfir](https://twitter.com/VladZamfir) is working on to implement access control mechanisms on the blockchain.

Another project aims to create a decentralized market for decentralized power distribution. The idea is that individuals or groups can meter, store, and exchange power within a local group, as well as sell it to the regional power grid.

#### TCS, India
Greg spoke with TCS, a large software services supplier (TATA) in India who is looking to implement blockchain services for their merchants.

#### Regulation on high level
Greg discussed smart contracts and securities with a panel of Australian regulators and legal experts. He explained some differences between contracts in the legal world, vs smart contracts capable of autonomous agency.

#### Concerns about Proof of Stake
Greg has been working with Ethereum on Casper, a 'proof of stake' protocol that could replace the expensive 'proof of work' system for verifying transactions on the blockchain. He is concerned that Casper might enable an attack against a transaction by pricing it out of the scheduling queue.

#### GLoSEval
Greg is working to patch a known bug in glosEval. Justin's importer has been pounding at it, causing server bounces and service bounces.

#### Eric & Dina help Noy with UI/design
Greg met with Eric & Dina. Dor confirms that the couple will be helping Noy design Synereo's new user interface.


### [LivelyGig Update](https://youtu.be/JH4GLfccKY8?t=900) <BR>

Ed is working on instructions to ease the setting up of an ami on Amazon AWS. He wants to get multiple nodes going so that we can start hitting the restful API.

#### Inspect traffic
Ed set up a sniffer to inspect the html traffic between splicious and the web server in order to better document the glosEval API. This is necessary to help the group in India (Nirvanic Labs) who is writing the user interface for LivelyGig.

#### Presentation in San Diego, Inside Bitcoins
Ed will be speaking at "inside bitcoins" in San Diego next week. To get an idea of how many bitcoin and blockchain startups there are, Ed refers us to a dashboard on William Mougayar’'s website:

### [Introducing Jed](https://youtu.be/JH4GLfccKY8?t=1159) <BR>

#### Dor about BnkToTheFuture
Talks are going on with [Bank To The Future](http://BnkToTheFure.com) about how to make the best pitch. Materials are being created for the site and campaign.

Dor introduced new member of Synereo, Jed, to handle marketing, public relations, branding, and community related matters.

#### Everybody talking about LivelyGig in the Valley
Jed expressed his surprise at how well LivelyGig was known by his community of contacts in Silicon Valley. 

### [Jed Describes Marketing and Community Plans](https://youtu.be/JH4GLfccKY8?t=1374) <BR>

Jed has been working behind the scenes for Synereo for more than a year now, advising us in every step of the way. Now he’ll be more in the forefront, directing a coordinated marketing effort and handling public relations.  Attached Google meta-document for marketing, message drivers, inclusion -coalition of people and applications tackling big issues in the bitcoin community.  Coordinate with weekly scribing task to pull ideas, and create Message Drivers.

Message drivers do the following:

1) Tell the underlying message used to inspire all copy <BR>
2) Make sure everyone is on the same page.

We want the messages leading to February to do the following: 
* Message of inclusion 
* Rallying community
* Keep us active in the media

Drivers: 
* We have spent the last six months tackling some of the biggest problems facing the community
* We have met with community members all over the world in order to work together. 
* We are collaborating with Ethereum, LivelyGig, other application builders, and you. 
* We can continue to live under centralized control, or we can work together to solve these problems. 
* Please join us on slack.

#### @work@Synereo
Greg says greg says blockchain community people are very inclusive. We are creating a movement. He suggested that we find more ways to reward community members with AMPs. 

#### To Do's for members
In order to help manage jobs for community members, Dor suggested the creation of a running list of to-dos that community members can take on in exchange for a AMP rewards. 

#### Decentralised Scribe
Hank summarized how the last Hangout Summary document was created: Hank created the initial document. Ian added a timeline, hank added pictures, then we both filled summaries of each section.

#### How to keep track
Jed wants summary process written down so he can keep track.  Build a road map.

### [What Are The Best Growth Vectors For Synereo?](https://youtu.be/JH4GLfccKY8?t=2015) <BR>
![Synereo Stack Diagram](http://i.imgur.com/juNN4vG.png)

The “Agent User Model” layer is referenced as “UserAgent” in the preceding LivelyGig Web UI Class diagram. This layer is common to Apps on this platform that share the same Introduction Protocol, Labels, and Aliases.

### [Further Discussion of Decentralized Reputation Systems](https://youtu.be/JH4GLfccKY8?t=3029) <BR>

Public information (Project, contest, offering, buyer profile, seller profile, moderator profile) are rebroadcast over the network, however contracts are not. There is likely, however, to be some mechanism by which LivelyGig derives a commission for facilitating the contract.

### [Dor Wants To Map Communities, Calls For Help](https://youtu.be/JH4GLfccKY8?t=3225) <BR>
![Connections and Storage on Synereo](http://i.imgur.com/SkjVm8g.png)


Storage and communications are expressed as channels / connections . Channels encapsulate layers of nested labels (meta-data) and private posts. Everyone is an “Agent” that has their own “self” channel that stores private communications. Every communication between Agents occurs over its own unique channel.

Greg compiled the latest Synereo node from Scala and demonstrated a visitor connecting to Synereo through a web front end. The UI is under active development. Greg is awaiting graphic assets from Noy so that he can re-skin to a more beautiful design.
