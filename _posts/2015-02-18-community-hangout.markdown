We’re hosting a community hangout today, February 18th, at 21:00 GMT. We're going to talk about content creation and distribution on Synereo, where artists will be able to take complete control over how they express themselves and enjoy a direct line to their fans, present and future.

Joining us are our advisory board member, Matt Black (Coldcut, Ninja Tune) and DJ Oil.

We'll also discuss Synereo's collaborative filtering system as well as how Amplification will help content creators both by spreading their message and through compensating them for their contributions.
