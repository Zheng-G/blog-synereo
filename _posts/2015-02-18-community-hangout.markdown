We’re hosting a community hangout today, February 18th, at 21:00 GMT. We're going to talk about content creation and distribution on Synereo, where artists will be able to take complete control over how they express themselves and enjoy a direct line to their fans, present and future.

Joining us are our advisory board member, Matt Black ([Coldcut](https://www.facebook.com/coldcutofficial), [Ninja Tune](https://www.facebook.com/ninjatuneofficial)) and [DJ Oil](https://www.facebook.com/djoil13).

We'll also discuss Synereo's collaborative filtering system as well as how Amplification will help content creators both by spreading their message and through compensating them for their contributions.
