### March 9, 2016 Synereo Community Hangout

This week, Greg joins the Hangout while in flight from Boston to Seattle. He is returning from a meeting at MIT with researchers and academics working to improve the scalability and security of decentralized computing.

**Ed demonstratse a live version of LivelyGig**; Dor clarifies the future structure of the Synereo for-profit and non-profit foundations; **Dor announces an investment from Israel's most highly connected investor, Gigi Levy**.

Turning down an offer from the US Navy, our Community Leader Christian has relocated to Seattle to promote Synereo full time. The Hangout begins with his discussion about creating an online Synereo TV channel (http://synereo.tc) on Twitch, where we can stream interviews, talks, and news concerning the decentralized social network.

### [09:32 --- LivelyGig Update](https://youtu.be/OMYjzSztFs0?t=9m32s)
Ed Eykholt of [LivelyGig](http://livelygig.com), the decentralized marketplace for freelancers, is working on protocol and escrow design. He is considering utilizing co-pay's wallet [(copay.io)](https://copay.io). **Ed demonstrates the application working** off of mock data to show live feeds in LivelyGig's message and job tabs.

### [13:50 --- Dor's Updates](https://youtu.be/2AuXvWjy6T8?t=13m50s)
 A number of Synereo community members have stepped up lately and are assuming more formal roles. John Malthus has been very active in posting about Synereo in Google Plus and other social media. Joeri has recently become involved in marketing efforts as well.

The famous Israeli tech investor, [Gigi Levy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigi_Levy-Weiss) has endorsed Synereo by purchasing $20,000 USD worth of AMP and has pledged another $10,000 for the coming crowd funding campaign that will offer both AMP and equity shares in Synereo Ltd. Dor is also getting advice and mentoring from startup whiz, [Roy Oron](https://www.linkedin.com/in/royoron).

### [23:01 --- Funding Model & Transaction Fees](https://youtu.be/OMYjzSztFs0?t=23m01s)
Dor is committed to not monetizing the Synereo social network or the platform on which it runs. These are open source and will run in a decentralized fashion. Any transaction fees collected will only be used to maintain the network. The company, Synereo Ltd., is designing additional for-profit services and applications to integrate on top of the open platform.

Transaction fees *must* be built into the platform in order for it to be self-sustaining and secure. (More on this later.) Through economies of scale, these fees will decrease as the network grows. The fees support the network mainly by reimbursing providers of network infrastructure (hosts) for dedicating bandwidth, computing power, and storage to the platform.

### [29:39 --- Greg's Meeting with the Ethereum Research Group in Boston](https://youtu.be/OMYjzSztFs0?t=29m39s)
Greg was in Boston to meet with Ethereum researchers and select academics to address issues regarding scalability, sharding, consensus, and metering. Some details as to their discussion are described here, including metering (_gas price_) across shards and mechanisms by which economic assurances can provide security guarantees for decentralized systems.

### [35:20 --- Casper Discussions on Reddit](https://youtu.be/OMYjzSztFs0?t=29m39s)
Greg comments on recent Reddit posts and clarifies that work on Casper is going well but is not yet finished. Recently two proofs have been put forward, showing that the betting cycles will converge as designed. Simulations have been run that also show convergence. Nevertheless, more evaluation is needed. The Casper group is actively seeking out further engagement and _good-willed skepticism_ from experts in this area.

### [43:40 --- Why Meter the Platform](https://youtu.be/OMYjzSztFs0?t=43m40s)
Ian asks Greg to elaborate on the comparison between Ethereum _gas_ and transaction fees on the Synereo platform. Greg replies that he and others see a convergence between the two platforms. They both rely on a metered virtual machine whose state is made robust by replication. That replication is kept in check through an economic consensus algorythm. Proof of work is one such algorythm, but it does not scale and is quite wasteful of compute resources. Sharding the block chain increases scalability by enabling individual validators to focus on a fragment of the blockchain instead of having to view the entire state of the blockchain. Metering is necessary so that economic forces can align with consensus to provide guarantees of availability, robustness, and security for the virtual machine state and the block chain state. The real costs of resource utilization (bandwidth, compute, storage) are factored into the economics of this alignment.

### [50:50 --- To Whom do the Transaction Fees Go?](https://youtu.be/OMYjzSztFs0?t=50m50s)
Greg explains that in addition to the hard costs of running the network (compute, bandwidth, mining/validation, storage) there are also costs involved in setting up code checking and deployment. Dor reiterates his assurances that these fees will be used to maintain the network and never for profit, which will further be examinable through the reports the company releases after being audited. The open-source design of the platform is both decentralized and self-sustaining. To avoid giving anyone the incentive to fork the project, every effort is being taken to avoid centralization of power.

Other open-source projects working on decentralized applications have started conducting hangouts like this one. The Ethereum working group has been holding weekly meetings which can be seen on YouTube. Greg also mentions IPFS (Inter-Planetar File System) whose weekly hangouts can be seen here:
