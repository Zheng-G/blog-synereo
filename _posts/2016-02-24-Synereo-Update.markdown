## Update Summary
This week, UI design ideas are discussed in depth, including concepts related to gamification.  Special focus is put on the search function in Synereo. How post relevance is sorted in the attention economy is explained, and how users can improve that function with additional inputs.  Our new Community Manager, Hendrik Jan Hilbolling, is announced and introduced.

##[Detailed notes]

###[05:00 --- Gamified design ideas](https://youtu.be/lhSj1hZ8wLw?t=5m) <br>
Christian gives a rundown of his perspective of one possible big target audience, and some gamified design ideas.  He gives a presentation regarding social problems of today, and an interesting mix of current ideas, culture, and technology.  He gives examples of Apps that could be monetized by entrepreneurs.

###[14:26 --- Comments on gamification](https://youtu.be/lhSj1hZ8wLw?t=14m26s)<br>
Dor comments on gamification.  Clarifies the idea of building the product first, and then going for large number of users.

###[15:34 --- Reputation on a blockchain; Factom](https://youtu.be/lhSj1hZ8wLw?t=15m34s) <br>
Dor talks about credentials, and the LivelyGig approach to trust in a transaction.  Then some info on Factom and the blockchain.  Not all info is public though, and privacy has a place too.

###[17:30 --- Open Access; credentials](https://youtu.be/lhSj1hZ8wLw?t=17m30s) <br>
Malthus John connects the idea of credentials for business reputation management to another potential market, the Open Access scientific publishing arena.  Alongside OA, higher education also has a problem with certifying abilities, and also to gain the full social value of the growth of MOOCs, and prepare people for living in modern society.

###[19:21 --- UI Design](https://youtu.be/lhSj1hZ8wLw?t=19m21s)<br>
Eric talks about the User Interface design, and core product vision.  He also adds more to the gamification subject.  He noted that games usually come out in one final version, whereas this will be more of a ‘rolling release’, being worked on and improved along the way.

###[28:34 --- The search function](https://youtu.be/lhSj1hZ8wLw?t=28m34s)<br>
The central concepts of the “AT” (@) and the “SHARP” (#), and how they tie into searches.  Search on a distributed network is an aggregated function, across nodes.  Dina follows up with information about search from the UX (User Experience) perspective.  A rich search environment is described, including includes/excludes, people, venues, channels, hashtags, etc.  The process should be easy to manage, and flexible.  Customization will be an important feature.   

When certain features get included will depend on the developer’s estimations of the time it will take to implement them.  

###[46:28 --- Attention economy & relevance](https://youtu.be/lhSj1hZ8wLw?t=46m28s)<br>
Dor brings up how in the Synereo attention economy, engagement on older posts will put posts back into fresh streams.  This includes personalization based on your local node, relationships, past topics, etc.  There is also some thinking about having more persistent locations, like  collections of things. 

###[50:21 --- User input: quality vs ease](https://youtu.be/lhSj1hZ8wLw?t=50m21s)
Dor also talks about the need for more input than the typical posting process in order to improve the standard results seen on other social networks, but that this has not been popular.  He asks for suggestions on this.  Dina says the design on posting is still being worked on, but that posting experience might be different depending on the context.  Eric adds that there can be elements of ‘free UX’, where people can create open places (similar to groups or communities) and others can add to it.  These could be public, private, secret, etc.

Malthus suggested a pop-up ‘helper bot’ that would follow up an easy, one-click posting process with some relevant hashtags, groups, or other ways the system could better signal where a particular post would go, and those could be accepted by the user with one click as well.

###[61:36 --- Community news](https://youtu.be/lhSj1hZ8wLw?t=1h1m36s)
Dor welcomed Bhokor to the community, who has been working on Spanish translations.  We now have Spanish Facebook and Twitter pages that will mirror the English ones.  

Hendrik (HJ) takes on the role of Community Manager.

##That's all for this week!!
