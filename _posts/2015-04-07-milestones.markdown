title: Crowdsale Milestones

The Synereo crowdsale is capped at $1.2m. Here is what we’re planning on doing with the funds we raise over the next 6 to 12 months, depending on the final amount. 

All milestones contain the previous ones.

**$115k**: Alpha release; distributed node software available to play with (PoC). 6 months.

**$330k**: Implementation of extensible APIs, allowing our developer community to grow and for development to proceed at a great pace. 6 months.

**$650k**: Beta application; improved user experience. 9 months.

**$900k**: Extend APIs to non-JVM environments. Greater ability to support both dev and user community. 9 months.

**$1.2m**: Allow the in-house app and 3rd party apps developed on top of the mature Synereo platform to host its first million users. 9-12 months.

A platform allowing devs to play with Synereo distributed software will be available in 6 months if we reach the first milestone in all cases. A beta application will be available within 9 months if we reach $650K in all cases.

We hope this provides a clear picture of what Synereo’s plan are - both in terms of the platform and in terms of the social networking application we wish to build - with the funds you’re supporting us with.

We appreciate each and every dollar contributed!
