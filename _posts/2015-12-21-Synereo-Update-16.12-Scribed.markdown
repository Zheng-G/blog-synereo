## Development Update
[As we continue the tradition of summarizing the updates of our weekly hangout](http://blog.synereo.com/2015/12/02/new-bounty/), here's what happened last week in Synereo, courtesy of our bright and brave community members.
<BR>

Greg has gotten many valuable insights into decentralized systems at #BlockchainSYD. Of note, Lawrence Lessig’s talk “Thinking Through Law and Code” provided valuable insights into how decentralized systems will affect the legal landscape. Most importantly, decentralized systems should be flexible and designed with compassion in mind, and allow for adjudication of their processes. In addition, Greg attended a collaborative Hackathon, where $50,000 was awarded to the winning idea, a project he participated in. 

Synereo Ltd. is working on creating its next new role for the community: the Ambassador. The Ambassador will be responsible for going out into established networks and being a liaison between various groups interested in Synereo. Ambassadors will play a key role in helping the early network find its community abroad. 

Dor announced the creation of a Q&A feature for the [Community Hangout](https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/109002904706315055045/events/cvnplaajtlu9oi07j2ut738ntm0)! Individuals will be able to submit text questions before and during the Community Hangout and have them answered live. In addition, he spoke about Bnktothefuture and our coming presale for investors, which will help us gain the best possible footing for moving forward. The price of AMPs was discussed, along with their increasing success in the market and the listing on [CoinMarketCap](http://coinmarketcap.com/assets/synereo/).

## Detailed Notes

### [05:53 - Greg about Hackaton in Sydney, Australia.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=hu-1OGan3Hg#t=353) <BR>

On December 11th, our CSO Greg attended the #BlockchainSYD Blockchain Workshops Hackaton event in Sydney Austraila. In our meeting he said that he was impressed by Lawrence Lessig's keynote given at the workshop on [Thinking Through Law and Code](https://vimeo.com/148665401). 

Lessig’s presentation brought up an interesting idea that decentralized systems like Synereo and Ethereum must consider. Synereo’s social contracts and Ethereum’s smart contracts are about automating aspects of behavior, taking human actors out of the process. Once such a contract is put on the blockchain, it executes completely autonomously. If you get the architecture right, you can’t take it down even if they’re controlling potentially critical digital assets, such as commodities like BTCs or AMPs. That may have consequences that the Synereo community needs to think through. 

We must carefully consider what controls to include in autonomous systems to keep them in balance. Financial markets use “circuit breakers” as a means to curb chaos in markets caused by algorithmic trading. Greg alluded to “Behavioral Types” as a possible solution.



### [12:41 - Acoustic separation in law](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=hu-1OGan3Hg#t=761) <BR>

During the hackathon event, Lawrence Lessig brought up another issue that is important for us to consider moving forward, the idea of “acoustic separation.” 

Lessig talks about “acoustic separation” meaning that you can be considered in one perspective to one party and be considered entirely differently to another party. This kind of subjectivity is difficult in the legal arena because it means that courts must be able to analyze and understand the context of a situation before applying judgement. Sometimes courts are put in the position to show mercy, they don’t just run law in a strict sense. Blockchain has a similar role, as it must make judgements on social contracts that are automated through its software. However, unlike courts, there is (currently) no room for mercy. Blockchain isn’t capable of understanding the context of a situation, and therefore it is strict every time. Lessig warns that groups working inside Blockchain must be conscious of these issues as they develop the technologies. 

### [17:57 - Legal requirements on contract “back doors”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=hu-1OGan3Hg#t=1077) <BR>

Some countries require, by law, that “back doors” be created in legal documents, in order to protect parties involved from fraud and forms of contract errors. Australia, for instance, requires that such back doors be put in for issues involving bad contracts. The flip side to this is that this creates a potential hole in security when you adopt this system over to a piece of code or a computer application. This is a substantial issue for Blockchain technologies, which seek to minimize the possibility of outside control from contracts. While there are no legal precedents on these issues in regards to Blockchain, court systems throughout the world may be called to weigh in on them. Which court, and what power they’ll have, however, is questionable, as Blockchain spans international jurisdictions. Already, sites like [BitRated](https://www.bitrated.com/Dor) exist to help find trusted arbiters to intermediate in multi-sig transactions, allowing only the trusted third parties of your choice to enter into a contract. Their reputation mechanism depends on direct and manually entered feedback from users (unlike Synereo’s “Reo” system, which curates feedback based on standard user behavior on the network). Ultimately, issues such as this will require that the legal system to be actively involved in the conversation about Blockchain. 

### [25:16 - Dor about decentralisation and large institutions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=hu-1OGan3Hg#t=1517) <BR>

The potential of decentralized systems is huge. With a decentralized alternative, large institutions like courts, banks, and insurance companies may need to respond with transparent and useful services if they want to be a part of decentralized services that social contracts can provide. This is another reason why compassion and mercy should be important considerations moving forward. As Jim stated in our discussion, “Trust is not a simple problem.” 

Dor mentions the discussion started by comments by Elon Musk about his fear of AIs representing the worst demons humanity has been dreading since the dawn of history, running rampant and without control. Elon has recently started a [non-profit AI research entity meant to advance humanity](http://fortune.com/2015/12/11/open-ai/) as a well without regard to financial return, and will put an emphasis on doing this right.
Dor mentions the book [*Accelerando*, a 2005 science fiction novel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerando), partially dealing with designing AI agents operating in decentralized networks and the effect this has on events leading up to the singularity. 

### [32:43 - Hackaton participation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=hu-1OGan3Hg#t=1963) <BR>

As a part of the Sydney event, Greg took part in a Hackathon which was organised around cooperation instead of competition. Greg was a part of the winning team! The winning idea involved communities being able to manage their energy in a decentralized way. In this system, individuals would carry their power with them wherever they went, swapping it out for various purposes such as fueling their home, their transportation, and trade. $50,000 was awarded to explore the idea further. 

### [39:39 - Dor’s update](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=hu-1OGan3Hg#t=2379) <BR>

Q&A has been enabled! From now on, participants and audience watching on youtube are invited to participate. Questions can be posed before the hangout begins or during it. We can also monitor Youtube and Google Hangout ‘comment sections’ during the meeting.

Dor created a [community directory](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B2oJ08sgSZdaWTBVODh0eFhKTmM), where all documents relevant to community efforts can be found. We are also creating a [map of communities](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1dgcYgLlhMdV8dJPxAGv0NjHCWDfRoJKvR9SVHIOd21Y) that are likely to be interested in utilizing Synereo or hearing about its benefits and development progress. We need ambassadors in these communities, to spread the word. The ambassadors will be AMP-lified, meaning ambassadors will be granted AMPs in exchange for helping to facilitate. Get in touch with [Dor](mailto:hello@synereo.com) for details! 

### [42:34 - Synereo on CoinMarketCap, market discussion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=hu-1OGan3Hg#t=2554) <BR>

Now you can see how the AMP is doing on [CoinMarketCap](http://coinmarketcap.com/assets/synereo/). Not only is the price of AMPs getting attention of late, it is already going up! 

### [43:34 - Technical updates; the DNA of the new Synereo application
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=hu-1OGan3Hg#t=2614) <BR>

The UI for Synereo is currently in development. Our team in India is working hard on the UI and back end, making sure that the system is smooth and efficient. A demo is in the works, but before it can be shared the data importer must be tested and approved. In order to make this happen, the team is ready to load test data in JSON format, which will let us know that we have a solid demo in place. Currently, one of the challenges that the team faces is that the docker image in the UI is stalled, because there are too many threads that need to be incorporated for it to work properly. This is a challenge we are confident the team can overcome. 

Dor talks about the DNA of the upcoming Synereo application: the three important focus points that will pervade the experience on the platform.

The LivelyGig documentation of the API is well under way.

### [55:18 - Drbloom and notion of Ceptrons, clarification from Dor
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=hu-1OGan3Hg#t=3318) <BR>

Many people ask about what Synereo as a company will do once the users own Synereo as a network. Its very important to distinguish the difference between Synereo the ‘Social Networking Application’ and Synereo Ltd., the company. One of the core tasks of Synereo Ltd will be facilitating the development of 3rd party apps to ride on top of Synereo. Because the Synereo social platform runs on SpecialK, you can build on top of Synereo any application that you want in a decentralized manner while utilizing the benefits of the social layer. The potential is vast, because all the services that you can get on the Internet now could be integrated into Synereo! 

Currently, the potential for different applications to interact with Synereo is profound:

### [1:00:02 - BnkToTheFuture and private Pre-Sale
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=hu-1OGan3Hg#t=3616) <BR>

Dor discussed an upcoming pre-sale for investors. This is not a sale of AMPs, but rather a direct investment by investors into the company. One of the great aspects of the upcoming deal with bnktothefure is that Synereo can already receive investments before the pitch goes live. The higher the pre-investment, the more chances there are for a higher final investment. This means that we have a lot to gain by having individuals invest early, primarily because we can speed up the development process and set up nodes for the Synereo network early. 

That's all for this week!
