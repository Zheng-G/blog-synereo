## Development Update
[As we continue the tradition of summarizing the updates of our weekly hangout](http://blog.synereo.com/2015/12/02/new-bounty/), here's what happened last week in Synereo, courtesy of our bright and brave community members.
<BR>

Greg has gotten many valuable insights into decentralized systems at #BlockchainSYD. Of note, Lawrence Lessig’s talk “Thinking Through Law and Code” provided valuable insights into how decentralized systems will affect the legal landscape. Most importantly, decentralized systems should be flexible and designed with compassion in mind, and allow for adjudication of their processes. In addition, Greg attended a collaborative Hackathon, where $50,000 was awarded to the winning idea, a project he participated in. 

Synereo Ltd. is working on creating its next new role for the community: the Ambassador. The Ambassador will be responsible for going out into established networks and being a liaison between various groups interested in Synereo. Ambassadors will play a key role in helping the early network find its community abroad. 

Dor announced the creation of a Q&A feature for the [Community Hangout](https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/109002904706315055045/events/cvnplaajtlu9oi07j2ut738ntm0)! Individuals will be able to submit text questions before and during the Community Hangout and have them answered live. In addition, he spoke about Bnktothefuture and our coming presale for investors, which will help us gain the best possible footing for moving forward. The price of AMPs was discussed, along with their increasing success in the market and the listing on [CoinMarketCap](http://coinmarketcap.com/assets/synereo/).

## Detailed Notes

### [Greg reports from Sydney, Australia](https://youtu.be/JH4GLfccKY8?t=187) <BR>

Greg is in Australia participating in a Hackathon on blockchain applications. Interesting projects include one that [Vlad Zamfir](https://twitter.com/VladZamfir) is working on to implement access control mechanisms on the blockchain.

Another project aims to create a decentralized market for decentralized power distribution. The idea is that individuals or groups can meter, store, and exchange power within a local group, as well as sell it to the regional power grid.

#### TCS, India
Greg spoke with TCS, a large software services supplier (TATA) in India who is looking to implement blockchain services for their merchants.

#### Regulation on high level
Greg discussed smart contracts and securities with a panel of Australian regulators and legal expertsm including [**Lawrence Lessig**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig). He explained some differences between contracts in the legal world, vs smart contracts capable of autonomous agency.

#### Concerns about Proof of Stake
Greg has been working with Ethereum on Casper, a 'proof of stake' protocol that could replace the expensive 'proof of work' system for verifying transactions on the blockchain. He is concerned that Casper might enable an attack against a transaction by pricing it out of the scheduling queue.

#### GLoSEval
Greg is working to patch a known bug in GLoSEval. Justin's importer has been pounding at it, causing server bounces and service bounces.

#### Eric & Dina help Noy with UI/design
Greg met with Eric & Dina, two world class experts in crafting user experiences. Dor confirms that the couple will be helping Noy design Synereo's new user interface.


### [LivelyGig Update](https://youtu.be/JH4GLfccKY8?t=900) <BR>

Ed is working on instructions to ease the setting up of an AMI on Amazon AWS. He wants to get multiple nodes going so that we can start hitting the restful API.

#### Inspect traffic
Ed set up a sniffer to inspect the HTML traffic between Splicious and the web server in order to better document the glosEval API. This is necessary to help the group in India (Nirvanic Labs) who is writing the user interface for LivelyGig.

#### Presentation in San Diego, Inside Bitcoins
Ed will be speaking at "inside bitcoins" in San Diego next week. To get an idea of how many bitcoin and blockchain startups there are, Ed refers us to a dashboard on William Mougayar’'s website: 

http://startupmanagement.org/2015/10/22/the-global-landscape-of-blockchain-companies-in-financial-services/


### [Introducing Jed](https://youtu.be/JH4GLfccKY8?t=1159) <BR>

#### Dor about BnkToTheFuture
Talks are going on with [Bank To The Future](http://BnkToTheFure.com) about how to make the best pitch. Materials are being created for the site and campaign.

Dor introduced new member of Synereo, Jed, to handle marketing, public relations, branding, and community related matters.

#### Everybody talking about LivelyGig in the Valley
Jed expressed his surprise at how well LivelyGig was known by his community of contacts in Silicon Valley. 

### [Jed Describes Marketing and Community Plans](https://youtu.be/JH4GLfccKY8?t=1374) <BR>

Jed has been working behind the scenes for Synereo for more than a year now, advising the team in every step of the way. Now he’ll be more in the forefront, directing a coordinated marketing effort and handling public relations.  Attached Google [meta-document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c1vJks6RAhTynbkKkgQvl8RUanlJRBTr2PnyB1zW-_g/edit#heading=h.70o0r96eoghg) for marketing, message drivers, inclusion -coalition of people and applications tackling big issues in the bitcoin community.  Coordinate with weekly scribing task to pull ideas, and create Message Drivers.

Message drivers do the following:

1) Tell the underlying message used to inspire all copy <BR>
2) Make sure everyone is on the same page.

We want the messages leading to February to do the following: 

* Message of inclusion 

* Rallying community

* Keep us active in the media

Drivers: 

* We have spent the last six months tackling some of the biggest problems facing the community

* We have met with community members all over the world in order to work together. 

* We are collaborating with Ethereum, LivelyGig, other application builders, and you. 

* We can continue to live under centralized control, or we can work together to solve these problems. 

* Please join us on slack.

#### @work@Synereo
Greg says greg says blockchain community people are very inclusive. We are creating a movement. He suggested that we find more ways to reward community members with AMPs. 

#### To Do's for members
In order to help manage jobs for community members, Dor suggested the creation of a running list of to-dos that community members can take on in exchange for a AMP rewards. 

#### Decentralised Scribe
Hank summarized how the last Hangout Summary document was created: Hank created the initial document. Ian added a timeline, hank added pictures, then we both filled summaries of each section.

#### How to keep track
Jed wants summary process written down so he can keep track.  Build a road map.

### [What Are The Best Growth Vectors For Synereo?](https://youtu.be/JH4GLfccKY8?t=2015) <BR>

Ed, Greg, and Dor discuss the growth of our platform and community. Who are are niche markets? What MVP will best serve them? Not all investors understand that we are a collaborative platform and not just one individual application. Massroots (https://massroots.com/) was given as an example cannabis related social network that has more than half a million members. They have strong interest in privacy, autonomy, and the resilience of their platform to attack. Rather than funneling users from existing networks, Dor suggests onboarding smaller groups and "building a giant out of midgets."

### [A Discussion of Decentralized Reputation Systems](https://youtu.be/JH4GLfccKY8?t=2484) <BR>

#### Engineers need a proper FreeLancePlatform

John Conlin on the Hangout is an alias of Patrick Mockridge, a chartered chemical engineer that has created http://engzig.com, a platform to disrupt engineering recruitment. It uses evernote, credly, and mozilla open badges to implement a reputation system for oil and gas professionals. He describes shortcomings in the recruitment systems currently in use, and how enzig would like to give engineers the ability to rate their peers work and establish reputations that they can own and store on a blockchain.

#### Greg's Comments on Reputation & Identity
At the hackathon, Greg discussed identity and reputation with Matan Field (https://twitter.com/MatanField) and Primavera De Filippi (https://twitter.com/yaoeo) who are working on backfeed (http://backfeed.cc/). Greg says , "there is this possibility that there are these recursive relationships amongst identity and reputation and the notion of channel and being able to observe the behavior of channels over time."

Dor discusses reputation on Synereo and points to the [attention economy slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12wZfRyF9XBMrc1ripXGfyNXCnO_MD7f2-Gc8AIa-v8o/pub?start=false&loop=false&slide=id.g4ecec4c43_37).


### [Dor Wants To Map Communities, Calls For Help](https://youtu.be/JH4GLfccKY8?t=3225) <BR>
Dor wants the community to create a document mapping the communities that might be interested in what synereo has to offer. (privacy groups, open source groups, etc) What functionality do they need? We can then tailor our messaging when we release new features.

### [Jed Discusses Our Roadmap for Marketing and Community Efforts, Calls for Help ](https://youtu.be/JH4GLfccKY8?t=3351) <BR>

Jed has begun a [roadmap document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c1vJks6RAhTynbkKkgQvl8RUanlJRBTr2PnyB1zW-_g/edit#heading=h.70o0r96eoghg) to keep us all on track.


That's all for this week!
