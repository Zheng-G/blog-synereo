In response to the amazing growth and activity we've seen in our community, Synereo is announcing a new role: the Ambassador. 

Ambassadors are responsible for going out into various communities across the web and acting as a liaison between them and Synereo. Ambassadors will play a key role in helping the early network establish partnerships with communities abroad.  

As Ambassadors, members will reach out to other community leaders and engage them about Synereo. In simple english, the Ambassadors will share links in communities that want them, and actively reach out to the leaders of these communities. Your job will be to establish a relationship with a few key communities, and get them the news they need when it works for them. This isn't about click-farming, far from it. This is about actually valuing people and helping communities work towards mutual goals, and playing a valuable role in the communities you are active in. 

Payouts for this role will be made on a weekly basis, and are based on reaching target goals within your community. Ambassadors will stay in touch with the community manager, and work together to help coordinate. The reward is `$15 to $50` dollars worth of AMPs per week, based on scope of work. Bonuses for extra sharing are available. 

This role is monumental in helping Synereo as we make our push to build a truly decentralized tool that will not only help other partners create decentralized applications, but build a strong community around decentralized cultures. It's more than just an app, we are working with others in the greater community to build a whole new way of interacting on a global scale. 


Here's a basic reward schedule we've whipped up. If you have other relevant tasks in mind, do come and talk to us on [Slack](http://slack.synereo.com).

1. Posting in a group: $5 in AMPs per week, per group. 
* Non-spammy. 
* Minimum Three per week. 
* Sharing Content, but also engaging in relevant conversation.

2. Starting a conversation with a group leaders: $10 in AMPs per group. (1 time per group) 
* Mailing Admins. 
* They Mail back. 
* Interested in Synereo, okay with us posting content and sharing in their group.  

3. Getting group leaders to present to us: $40 USD in AMPs. (1 time per group). 
* They can present on either on Slack, or via google hangouts. 
* Talk about their group and org on our site or hangout. 
* In that meeting we can figure out how they can help us and vice versa.


To apply, please send an email to hello@synereo.com.

Priority will be given to people who are already active participants in the hangouts/community and those who attach a sample of their writing - a post on a forum, a blog post, or anything showing that you can communicate with others in writing in an open and friendly way.
