We’re hosting a community hangout tomorrow, February 25th, at 21:00 GMT. We’re going to talk about music sharing and social networking on Synereo, where artists collaborate with fans to create the venue.

![Party Music Hangout](/img/uploads/party-music-hangout-2c.jpg){: style="float: left; height: 450px; margin-right: 15px;"}
 
Joining us are Bert Lams and Paul Richards of the [California Guitar Trio](http://www.cgtrio.com/) and [Tony Levin](http://www.papabear.com/) (Peter Gabriel, King Crimson).

We’ll also discuss Synereo’s attention model as well as how Amplification will help content creators both by spreading their message and through compensating them for their contributions; but, mostly we'll be listening to Bert, Paul, and Tony share with us their views on music sharing, connecting with their audience, and social networking.

Join us on: [Google Hangouts on Air](https://plus.google.com/u/0/events/cj7koi7v9u10g523u3dtr7gj6co), this evening at 21:00 GMT.
