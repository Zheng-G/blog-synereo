[MasterXchange](https://masterxchange.com), the exchange used to trade AMPs, is closing down. Our friends at Omni assure us that their decentralized exchange, featuring the AMP token and many others and allowing trade between any two pairs of coins, will be live soon.

In the meantime, we want to get AMPs listed on standard exchanges. The following exchanges only list coins if they see a demand for them, and *this is where you come in*. The more these exchanges see interest by way of community requests, the more likely they are to list our tokens.

To make it all easy, here’s the information you can simply copy-paste into their forms:

Feel free to edit the information as you wish - it will help show your genuine interest.

### Withdrawing AMPs to Omniwallet

On November 17th, 2015[ MasterXChange](https://masterxchange.com) will stop providing support for their exchange. If you hold your AMPs there, make sure to transfer them to[ Omniwallet](https://omniwallet.org/) before that time. There is no need to register; you can simply click "Create a Wallet" on the top right of the home page, fill in a password, and click the “Create Wallet” button.

Take note of your Wallet ID and the quick login URL as you will need these to login next time. On Omniwallet, you have the option to backup your wallet and we strongly recommend doing so for peace of mind.

Click on "My addresses" on the left hand side:

![addresses.png](/img/uploads/addresses.png){: style="width: 157px;"}

You will see a "Wallet Options" button on top of the address list:

![backupwallet.png](/img/uploads/backupwallet.png){: style="width: 218px;"}

Select "Backup Wallet" and you will be able to download a .json file with your private keys and addresses. The filename will include your Wallet ID. Keep this file safe, you will always be able to import your wallet in Omniwallet if any issue arises.

To transfer coins from MasterXChange to Omniwallet simply send them to one of the Bitcoin Addresses shown in your Omniwallet.
